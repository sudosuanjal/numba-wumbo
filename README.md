# 🎮 NumbaWumbo

A goofy lil' terminal game where you try to guess the secret number chosen by RNG magic ✨.  
Built with Rust 🦀, full of Gen-Z slang, and way too many emojis.

---

## 🔢 How it works

- The game picks a **random number between 1 and 1000**.
- You keep guessing until you get it right.
- Too high? Too low? The game roasts you until you find the W.
